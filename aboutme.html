      Things you should know about me…. I am a mother of 3 gorgeous humans <br>  They are my gifts that never stop giving..... love, cuddles, laughter and heaps of challenges - I am so grateful.   I have a husband who challenges, encourages and supports me in ALL my wanderings physically and emotionally - I am so lucky.  My wider family and my community of friends,  built on honesty and acceptance,  keep me energised with a dash of FUN -  I am blessed.

I am passionate about Life......mine and others, forever exploring the ways to expand so that the experience continues to be magical.  Diving deep into the internal landscape and finding ways to unlock, open up and allow our light to shine out.  

I am in awe of the functioning of the human body and the need to move, with this in mind I completed my Personal Training certificate.  Understanding the importance of fitness, strength and flexibility, I wanted to support others with their health and fitness goals.  Some time later and through my practice of mindfulness I went deeper into my wellbeing and completed my Yoga Teacher training.

I am immersed in learning and sharing about the many ways therapeutic grade Essential Oils can offer a natural support for health and wellbeing….as an alternative to domestic toxins used around the home and an effective way to find balance in our emotions.

Adventures, painting, writing, travelling, trail hiking, dancing, music, are the other areas where I find the space to create and sparkle
